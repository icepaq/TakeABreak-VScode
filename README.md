# Take a Break
A timer extensoin for VSCode.

## Introduction
It's important to take periodic breaks when sitting infront of a screen for hours. This extension will remind you every 30 minutes to take a break. 

As soon as you come back reset the timer by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P then find the "Reset Timer" command. If you do not open VSCode to an existing file, reset the timer when you open one.

## Warning
This extension has NOT been tested thoroughly. If you find any bugs, let me know by creating a new issue. You can fix it yourself as well and create a new PR.
